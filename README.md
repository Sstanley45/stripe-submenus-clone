# Sidemenu with Context API and useEffect

This is a Stripe web clone built with ReactJS. The app features a sidebar menu with submenus that are displayed when hovering over the buttons on the navigation menu. The state management is achieved using the Context API and useEffect hook.

# How It's Made

The app is developed using ReactJS. The sidebar menu and submenus are rendered conditionally based on the state managed by the Context API. The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects, such as updating the state or subscribing to events, when the component mounts or certain dependencies change.
